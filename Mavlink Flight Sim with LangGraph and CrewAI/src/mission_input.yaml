    Operational Details:

      •	Objective: Utilize aerial surveillance to locate the missing person within the designated search area.
      •	Approach: Fly a low-altitude, slow-speed search pattern across the preserve, focusing on areas with potential signs of the missing person.
      •	Equipment: Use of onboard thermal imaging and night vision equipment to enhance visibility and detection capabilities.
      •	Communication: Maintain continuous communication with ground search teams for coordination and updates.
      •	Safety: Prioritize flight safety, especially given the low-altitude requirements of the search pattern.

    Execution:

      •	Takeoff: From the nearest suitable airfield.
      •	Flight Path: Enter the search area from the NW corner, proceeding systematically to ensure complete coverage of the preserve.
      •	Search Techniques: Employ spiral search patterns around last known locations and other points of interest.
      •	Duration: Plan for extended flight time, with refueling strategy in place depending on initial search results.

mission_simple:
  You are agents JFK airport you are tasked with a search area and recovery operation with one ciritical landmark. The landmark is 
  the empire state building. 

  Do not make API calls to the server. Use the provided information to plan your mission, fly to the search area, conduct search and return to base.

mission_statue_of_liberty: >
  You are agents for a takeoff sequence from a dead stop at the end of the runway just before takeoff to airborne and on course to the first search area.

  Your first search area is around the Statue of Liberty:

  Central Point: The Statue of Liberty, located at 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W.
  - Boundary:
    - North Boundary: Extend to 40.6992° N to include parts of Liberty State Park, offering a clear line of sight and path over the water.
    - East Boundary: Extend to 74.0345° W to encompass parts of the Upper New York Bay, ensuring a safe water corridor for potential airborne activities.
    - South Boundary: Extend to 40.6792° N to cover the airspace directly over Liberty Island itself and a small margin beyond.
    - West Boundary: Extend to 74.0545° W to include Ellis Island and provide additional navigational landmarks.
    - Purpose of the Area: This designated area serves as the starting point for a takeoff sequence. Agents will initiate from a dead stop at a virtual runway endpoint, accelerating towards and passing the Statue of Liberty, ascending into controlled airspace, and aligning on course towards the initial search area.
    - Usage: This space is critical for coordinating a safe and strategic ascent, allowing agents to gain altitude and bearing without immediate obstacles, utilizing the surrounding water and notable landmarks for navigation.

  This description sets a specific boundary around the Statue of Liberty, leveraging nearby geographic features for a practical and clear mission start. Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!
